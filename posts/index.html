		The beauty of a home setup is having the space and flexibility to take advantage of multiple displays. But you just can’t get that experience if you want to be portable. Razer’s new Project Valerie aims to change that.</p>
	<p>
	If you thought Acer’s $9,000 laptop was absurd, that’s at least something you can soon own (assuming you have the money). With Project Valerie, Razer has dreamt up a concept that might not even make it to market. But if this is the next innovation in portable desktops, sign me up, because Valerie is unlike anything we’ve ever seen.
	</p>
	<p>
	Project Valerie is system that takes advantage of three 17.3-inch 4K IGZO displays, which all combine to provide users with the most efficient and immersive experience possible. The device opens up like a normal laptop, but once its automatic deployment mechanism kicks in, the other monitors will deploy for even more space to work with. It’s like a butterfly spreading its beautiful wings.
</p><p>
The laptop (if you want to call it that) is essentially a 17-inch Razer Blade Pro with two additional monitors attached to it. So not only are you getting the convenience of a multi-monitor setup, but you’re getting the raw power of Razer’s most beastly machine.
</p><p>
Razer says the proposed system measures at 1.5 inches thick and weigh less than 12 pounds. To keep the machine cool, Razer says Project Valerie comes equipped with the company’s renowned thermal management system, along with a custom-designed fan and dynamic heat exchanges that pair with a vapor chamber. In other words, Valerie should stay cool, whether you’re gaming or just doing regular work.
</p><p>
“Multi-monitor desktop setups are becoming more necessary for professionals, creators, and gamers,” said Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO. “For the first time, we’ve engineered a solution that users can take with them. Project Valerie promises all of the functionality of three screens and none of the hassle.”</p>
